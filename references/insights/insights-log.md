### Project Areas
- PR Review & Repository Management (~3 sessions)
- Dev Activity Report Skill Development (~1 session)
- Statusline Script Enhancement (~1 session)
- Documentation & Activity Summaries (~1 session)
- CLAUDE.md Configuration Updates (~1 session)

### Usage Pattern
Highly operational and pipeline-oriented. Heavy Bash usage (83 calls). Concise directives, autonomous execution, close verification. Predominantly documentation/config-driven (Markdown 52 of language touches). High-tempo workflow orchestrator issuing commands and iterating through execution-verification cycles.

### Wins
- Multi-repo PR review and merge lifecycle in single sessions
- Iterative skill development with build-and-verify discipline; caught cache fingerprinting bug during warm-cache verification
- Self-improving Claude configuration: feeding insights back into CLAUDE.md via PRs

### Friction
- Calculation/logic errors requiring multiple corrections (usage % formula took 2+ rounds)
- Misinterpreted request scope (credential rotation confused with CLAUDE.md content)
- Subtle cache/file operation bugs (mtime fingerprinting bug only caught during verification)

### Top Tools
Bash (83), Read (32), Edit (30), Write (8), Task (8), Glob (4)

### Outcomes
5 fully achieved, 2 mostly achieved
