# .dev-report-fingerprint-ignore
# Glob patterns (fnmatch) for files/paths to exclude from content-hash fingerprinting.
# One pattern per line. # lines are comments. Blank lines are ignored.
# Patterns match against both the relative path and the filename alone.
#
# This file is respected by:
#   - scripts/phase1_runner.py  (python pipeline runner)
#   - SKILL.md Phase 1 instructions  (Claude CLI / claude -p version)
#
# Purpose: exclude files that change on every pipeline run so warm cache hits
# are possible when the actual codebase has not changed.
